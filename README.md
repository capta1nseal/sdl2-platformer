# sdl2-2d-game

A fun little free-time project to develop my c++ and game design skills

## Authors and acknowledgment

Created by Aidan Walker
Thanks to SDL2's devs, it handles the hardware and lets the developer focus on everything else (plus it has some good simple features for games)

## License

Licensed under the GNU general public license version 3 (GPL 3.0). The license can be found in the root folder of the project.

For the uninitiated, that means this program and its source code are very free to distribute and modify. I encourage you to do some research on licenses if you want to know more. A great place to start is creative commons.
